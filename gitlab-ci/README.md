# `/gitlab-ci`

This folder contains YAML files that are referenced by `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

Currently there are two main folders: `aws` and `gcp`.

`aws` contains two templates: `cloudformation.yml` and `cdk.yml`. `cdk.yml` is the preferred way to deploy infrastucture and make updates to the application.
