This topic covers implementign a Hacker News clone with GraphQL using Graphene and Apollo.

For Graphene, I followed along with this tutorial: [https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-python/0-introduction/](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-python/0-introduction/)

To setup the Apollo client with Vue Apollo, I followed along with the following resources:
